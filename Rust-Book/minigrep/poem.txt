I am a ghost! And you, who might be?
A phantom too? Then we are free.
A secret fellowship, just we twoâ€”
The world would chase us, if they knew.

How dull it must be to shine so bright,
To flaunt your name in the glaring light.
Croaking your praises from dawn till dusk,
While all around you simply husk.
